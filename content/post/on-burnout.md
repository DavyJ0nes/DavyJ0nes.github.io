# The Incident
The Harvard Business Review describes burnout as a [slow fizzle](https://hbr.org/1996/07/when-executives-burn-out), generally it is not something that you are aware is happening until it blows up in your face. In my case the worst incident was regaining conciousness while on the phone to a colleague and friend of mine, where I was shouting at him for something innocuous after having smashed up my home office and fracturing my little finger - good thing I'm not that strong!

# The Causes
The reasons for how I ended up doing something that is out of character and frankly inexcusable are numerous but all under the umbrella of my job.

In November 2015 I was employed as the first hire in a tech company whose product aims to provide footfall analytics to the events industry. In hindsight I really shouldn't have taken the job as the technical leadership was non-existent, all the low level knowledge of how the product was built was with an outsourced agency who were not native English speakers and the product was a hodgepodge of unfinished features that resulted in a large amount of technical debt. But alas I was inexperienced so didn't know any better and the allure of working for a startup and the promise of equity was too much. 

Fast-forward a year to November 2016 and I had successfully brought in a friend of mine to help with development and managing to understanding of the 100,000 line platform. The founding CTO had decided to leave the company leaving me to pick up the pieces. We rush hired another friend of mine to come in and try to manage customers. I felt like I had to provide leadership while not having the self confidence nor experience to really do it. And all the while the list of things that I needed to learn was mounting up. 

If I wasn't working I was thinking about work, I felt guilty when I wasn't working, I was constantly distracted when spending time with my girlfriend, I drank too much to escape from thinking about work as well as to help to sleep and all the while the slow fizzle of the detonation cord was continuing under the surface.

It's hard to put into words because the individual things that happened are very manageable and seem insignificant when presented here and now that I am on the other side of a low point in my life it is easy to wonder what all the fuss was about.

# The Aftermath
For about 3 weeks I was in a daze, I didn't care about anything, I didn't enjoy anything and I still have trouble enjoying supposedly fun things 2 months later.

**Immediately following the incident** I decided to drive and camp in the middle of the [Brecon Beacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecon_Beacons) for a couple nights, which could have been super dangerous but I needed to escape. I ended up having a few panic attacks and breakdowns that I consider aftershocks.

The **Monday** following the incident I returned to work where I was barraged by accusations that I can't just take time out and that I am a problem in the company and that no-one know how to fix anything (bearing in mind it is all documented in our wiki).

The **Tuesday** following the incident I went to the doctors to look at my finger and was advised to not return to work for 2 weeks, I was given a doctors note to make it official. This prompted me calling the founder of the company and saying that I needed to have some time to sort myself out and that I wouldn't be contactable, he was confused why, so I just [reiterated that I needed to take some time off](blog/on-burnout/#other-people-s-problems-are-just-that-other-people-s). 

**Two weeks after** the incident and I had not looked at my work emails once, I had been meditating for 10mins every day, exercising more, started reading some non work related books, was cooking more and the aftershock panic attacks were lessening.

After **Three weeks** and with the time of my doctor authorised sick leave drawing to a close I reached out to my colleague and friend who I had ranted to so that we could catch up over a drink and try to just be mates for a couple hours without having to talk about what had happened. This was really good and having the separation between work and personal was good.

I am now back full-time. I have made a conscious effort to give up some of the control within the company to others in the team, this has been hard and is a constant struggle because I can be a control freak but it means that others have to step up. The balance of work has changed too and I am trying to work on more proactive projects work rather than reactive work. This gives me the dopamine hit that I have completed something of worth and in the long run provides better value to the company.

Surprisingly there hasn't been any catch up or review with any of my managers apart from a casual, "how you doing? Ready to come back?". This is frustrating but reinforces the realisation that no-one is going to help you but yourself.

# Conclusions

### You Shouldn't Feel Embarrassed
Taking time off work due to stress related illnesses can be really embarrassing. Feeling like you are weak, or a failure, or that you are letting people down is natural for the personality types that are susceptible to burning out. But this is part of the problem and cause of burning out, give yourself a break, acknowledge your successes and don't shy away from

### A Job Is Just A Job
It is absurd to think that a job should define who you are. I could associate most things that I did or was interested in to my job or career during the lead up to when I blacked out. Most companies don't expect that so why should you put that on yourself

### Other People's Problems Are Just That
Just because someone asks you to do something doesn't mean you have to, irrelevant of how they express themselves. 

As an example let's say that a colleague is fretting over a client request, they interrupt you while you are in the middle of trying to troubleshoot a complex problem (it's taken you 20 mins just to understand the problem domain and load all of it in your head).

### It Just Takes Time
There doesn't seem to be any shortcuts in moving forward after a burn out. From talking to others who have gone through similar episodes you're never able to return to how you were and it can take a very long time, even years, to regain the same passion and love that you used to have for your work.

Two months after the incident it is a struggle at times to get into the frame of mind to work on technical problems and write code, which I used to really enjoy and had a lot of passion for. I still have panic attacks, that are mostly triggered by social situations and I constantly worry about my career and if I'm in the right environment to improve.

### Protect Yourself Because No One Else Is Going To Do It For You
It's very rare to have colleagues or managers care that you burnt out or even understand what burn out is. This means that unless you are fortunate enough to work with good managers then you are going to have to look after yourself and to not fall back into old habits that will lead to the same conclusion.

### The Root Of the Problem is Imposter Syndrome
For me personally the largest contributing factor to my burn out was the constant feeling that I am not good enough and that the only way to validate my knowledge and worth was to work, learn and level up all the time. Otherwise known as [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) this fear of being found out can be a great motivator but taken too far it can eat you up inside and never allow you to give yourself credit for the good work you have done.

My thing with Imposter Syndrome is feeling that I'm too far behind because I didn't get into tech at age 8, don't have a Computer Science/Maths/Physics degree and feel like I haven't built anything that I don't consider a toy project, tutorial, collection of scripts. I've caught myself saying:

> "I'm not a real developer, I just hack about until it works."

# Postscript
If you have made it this far then I hope that my rambling was of some use. The primary motivation for getting this all written down is that by sharing my story it will raise the awareness that burnout is more common than people think, especially it seems within the tech industry.

I am very fortunate to have had a loving family and amazing girlfriend support me through this period in my life.
