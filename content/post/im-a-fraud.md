+++

I have a problem in that I feel inadequate every day. Sometimes I can control the outward display of the fear but some days, like today, it is all consuming and stops me from doing anything of use.

This has to stop!!!!

With an obligatory web search you could attribute my fear of failure to Imposter Syndrome.

This is good, now I have a name for it. Now I need to kill it because I'm too fucking good to be dealing with this bullshit, I've got work to do.

Imposter Syndrome is commonly defined as the feeling of inadequacy in a professional context. Individuals - often high achievers - live in fear of being exposed as frauds. Well, this certainly makes a lot of sense. My current bout with this overwhelming fear of being found out has been triggered by applying for a job at a Cloud enablement company as a DevOps Engineer. This is a job that I'm pretty sure that I can do, I probably won't be the worlds greatest on day one but my super power (let's call it that for the sake of argument) is that I will be the best - it's just an amount of time. Oh wait, here's the fucking problem, I think I'm something special, which is adding pressure to be better than I am. Hmmm... OK... That's going in the list. 

Let's talk about the trigger that caused me to spiral out of control today.

Tomorrow I have a video call with the DevOps lead at the company I'm applying for. This guys is super legit on paper - CS undergrad, Cognitive Science Masters, all the AWS certifications, 12 years experience the whole fucking 9 yards. If there was a qualification to expose me for the fraud that I am this motherfucker has got it. 

I am so not ready to handle this boss.

In my head, tomorrow is going to go like this. The conversation will start nice and easy, chilled out conversation about me and why I want to join the company. Then it will move onto me talking about what I have done so far (basically why do I feel I'm qualified to do the job). He'll probably talk about the team structure, the nature of the work that sort of thing. We'll then transition to more technical questions and here is where I will fuck up and embarrass myself. My CV is accurate, I'm not expressly lying about anything but the experience that I have within the Technical Skill Set is basic at best. Again, I will be discovered to be a fraud.

# Time out

OK, so what is the fucking alternative? I am not enjoying my current job at all. The team dynamic is shit, there doesn't seem to be any definitive direction to the company because I'm not doing it. We are a ship lost in the night.

So I can't stay here, I'm fed up with Portsmouth as a City, Beth's not happy here. Time to fucking nut up and get this job so you can get the fuck out of dodge and start afresh. Fuck the company, fuck your colleageus, fuck your friends. I've had enough of this self loathing, floating through life shit.
