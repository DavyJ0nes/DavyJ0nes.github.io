      <description> Symptoms try and run a command and get this:
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional  Cure It is to do with your TERM enviroment setting. Running echo $TERM will return something like screen-256color this needs to be changed. I have had success with the following:
export TERM=ansi  You should also Change this in your .bashrc/.zshrc if after a reboot you get the same issue.

      <description>1. What is tmux? tmux is a terminal multiplexer!
2. What is a terminal multiplexer? It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.
Effectively a shell within a shell. Or a Ghost in the shell?
3. Why should I care? Say you are SSH&amp;rsquo;d into a box and want to run a process that you know will have to run for a long time and you do not want to get interuppted by say your SSH session closing.</description>
